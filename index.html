      <h3> Synopsis </h3>
      <p> "Blade Runner 2049" is a science fiction film released in 2017, directed by Denis Villeneuve 
         and starring Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, and Ana de Armas. The movie is set in a dystopian future 
         where humans have created genetically engineered beings called replicants to perform dangerous tasks. 
         The story follows a new replicant blade runner named K, played by Gosling, 
         who uncovers a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge society into chaos. 
         In his quest for answers, K seeks out the former blade runner Rick Deckard, played by Ford, 
         who has been missing for thirty years. Together, they uncover a conspiracy 
         that forces them to question what it means to be human and the very nature of their existence. 
         Along the way, K forms a bond with a replicant named Joi, played by de Armas, who gives him a newfound sense of purpose 
         and helps him navigate the dangerous world of Los Angeles in 2049</p>

  <h3> My thoughts </h3>
  <p> Blade Runner 2049 was only released in 2017 but it's a film I watched several times over already.
      The world building is really immersive, every scene is given room to breathe while also moving the plot forward.
      Visuals, soundtrack & acting are all perfect. No Oscar has been more deserving than Roger Deakins 2017 for his Cinematography. 
      It's not the first film to discuss what it means to be human via clones or AI but I think it does it in the most 
      thought provoking and creative ways.

<h2> 2. Lord Of The Rings </h2>

  <div class="synopsis">
    <h3> Synopsis </h3>
    <p> "The Lord of the Rings" is a trilogy of epic fantasy novels by J.R.R. Tolkien that was adapted into a film series
         directed by Peter Jackson in the early 2000s. The films follow the journey of a hobbit named Frodo Baggins,
         played by Elijah Wood, who inherits the One Ring, an ancient and powerful artifact created by the dark lord Sauron 
         to control and enslave the people of Middle-earth. Along with a fellowship of other characters, including the wizard Gandalf,
         the dwarf Gimli, the elf Legolas, and the humans Aragorn, Boromir, and Samwise Gamgee, Frodo embarks on a perilous quest to destroy the Ring 
         and defeat Sauron before he can conquer Middle-earth. The journey takes them through dangerous territories, including the Mines of Moria,
         the forests of Lothl√≥rien, and the fiery depths of Mount Doom, where the Ring must be destroyed. 
         Along the way, the fellowship faces numerous challenges and battles, 
         as well as the internal struggles of each character as they face their own fears and doubts.

    <h3> My Thoughts </h3>
    <p> Lord of the Rings helped pave the way for so many great fantasy shows and films over the last 20 years.
        It remains the blueprint in so many ways. The Battle for Helms deep is still the greatest battle ever filmed in my opinion,
        the score is second to none and the trilogy brings Tolkien's Middle Earth to life in a way that some fantasy book adaptions aren't able to.
        I feel that's a big reason why it was able to make so many people fans of the genre,
        the films establish the lore, different regions & their customs, creatures etc particularly well.

<h2> 3. Jurassic Park </h2>

  <div class="synopsis">
    <h3> Synopsis </h3>
    <p> "Jurassic Park" is a science fiction thriller film released in 1993, directed by Steven Spielberg 
         and based on the novel by Michael Crichton. The film follows a billionaire named John Hammond, 
         played by Richard Attenborough, who creates a theme park on an isolated island where dinosaurs have been cloned 
         using genetic engineering technology. A group of scientists, including Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern),
         and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), are invited to the park to endorse its safety to investors. 
         However, things quickly go wrong when a tropical storm hits the island and causes the power to go out, 
         freeing the genetically-engineered dinosaurs from their enclosures. 
         As the group tries to survive and escape the island, they face danger from the massive predators that roam the park, 
         including a tyrannosaurus rex and velociraptors. The film explores themes of science, ethics, and the dangers of playing God with genetic engineering,
         as the characters struggle to survive against the incredible power and unpredictability of the dinosaurs.

    <h3> My Thoughts </h3>
    <p> The original Jurassic Park is still the best Dinosaur movie (honourable mention The Land Before Time) & who doesn't love Dinosaurs?
        Unlike the rest of the franchise the original gets the pacing just right and fleshes out it's interesting characters while the tension builds.
        Ian Malcolm in particular is one of my favourite characters in any movie and has a ton of great lines.
        "Life finds a way".

<h2> 4. Pan's Labyrinth </h2>

  <div class="synopsis">
    <h3> Synopsis  </h3>
    <p> "Pan's Labyrinth" is a dark fantasy film released in 2006, written and directed by Guillermo del Toro. 
         The story takes place in Spain in 1944, where a young girl named Ofelia, played by Ivana Baquero, 
         moves with her pregnant mother Carmen to a remote military outpost to live with her new stepfather, Captain Vidal. 
         As Ofelia deals with the difficulties of adjusting to her new life, she discovers a magical world of mythical creatures in an ancient labyrinth nearby. 
         There, she meets a faun who tells her that she is a long-lost princess of the underworld and that in order to return home, she must complete three dangerous tasks. 
         As she navigates the labyrinth and completes each task, Ofelia becomes more deeply involved in the violent and oppressive realities of the real world around her, 
         as her stepfather hunts down rebels who oppose the fascist regime of General Francisco Franco. 
         The film blends fantasy elements with the brutal realities of war and dictatorship, exploring themes of rebellion, 
         sacrifice, and the power of imagination as a means of coping with trauma and injustice.

  <h3> My Thoughts </h3>
    <p> Pan's Labyrinth is incredibly rewatchable for such a serious and emotional film.
        del Torro & the costume designers bring to life some of the more memorable creatures I can recall, I love the score and 
        the ending really sticks with you.

<h2> 5. Swingers </h2>

  </div>
  <div class="synopsis">
    <h3> Synopsis </h3>

         The film follows the lives of four friends, including struggling actor and comedian Mike Peters, played by Favreau, and his friend Trent, played by Vince Vaughn,

</div>
  
    <h3> My Thoughts </h3>
    <p> "You're so money and you don't even know it" Swingers doesn't have to try too hard to be a really cool & stylish film.
         I think the friendship themes are what resonated most to me.
         Male friendships can often have a competitive aspect to them but Swingers also highlights the importance of uplifting
         your mates at times aswell.
